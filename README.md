# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Download the dataset.
Load the activity and feature info.
Load both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns mean and std.
Load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset.
Merges the two datasets.
Convert the activity and subject columns into factors.
Creat a tidy dataset that consists of the mean of each variable for each subject.
The result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
